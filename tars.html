        <p>To address delays caused by high ticket volumes across global sites, We developed TARS (Ticket Assignee & Removal System), a Python-based solution for automated ticket management. The system handles ticket assignments in real-time and automatically cleans up resolved tickets, eliminating the need for manual intervention. This automation resulted in a <b>78%</b> reduction in administrative workload, allowing support teams to focus on actual problem-solving. TARS now efficiently manages over <b>290+</b> daily tasks, significantly improving ticket resolution times and overall service delivery across <b>4 International Sites</b>. The system's implementation has streamlined the entire ticketing process, making it more efficient and responsive to user needs.</p>
