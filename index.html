            <h3>TARS – Ticket Assignee & Removal System</h3>
            <img src="images/tars.png" class="modal-img" alt="TARS">
            <p>To address delays caused by high ticket volumes across global sites, I developed TARS (Ticket Assignee & Removal System), a Python-based solution for automated ticket management. The system handles ticket assignments in real-time and automatically cleans up resolved tickets, eliminating the need for manual intervention. This automation resulted in a 78% reduction in administrative workload, allowing support teams to focus on actual problem-solving. TARS now efficiently manages over 290 daily tasks, significantly improving ticket resolution times and overall service delivery across all locations. The system's implementation has streamlined the entire ticketing process, making it more efficient and responsive to user needs.</p>

            <h3>Automated Email Handover System</h3>
            <img src="images/email.png" class="modal-img" alt="Email Automation">
            <p>To address the problems of manual email handovers between shifts, I developed an Automated Email Handover System using Python. The system automatically collects daily task information and creates standardized handover reports, which are then sent to team members at scheduled times. By eliminating manual data entry and formatting, the automation increased reporting accuracy by 70% and ensured consistent information sharing between shifts. This simple but effective solution has significantly reduced miscommunication and improved workflow continuity across all shift transitions, making team handovers more reliable and efficient.</p>

            <h3>Browser QA Automation – Tampermonkey Userscripts</h3>
            <img src="images/qa.png" class="modal-img" alt="QA Scripts">
            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Manual QA tasks were repetitive and error-prone, especially during large-scale launches.</p>
            <p><strong>Action:</strong> Developed userscripts to automate critical QA checks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🏷 CTI Finder – helps route tickets faster</li>
                <li>✉️ Template Generator – pre-filled standard replies</li>
                <li>🖋 Markdown Inserter – adds formatted text for clarity</li>
                <li>🎯 Value Highlighter – detects common errors in merge cases</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Improved QA accuracy, reduced oversight, and streamlined team workflows.</p>
